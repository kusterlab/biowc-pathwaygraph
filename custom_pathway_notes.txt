Done:
- mode: viewing/editing
    - Create storybook with switch, same as for the hue + upload and download button
    - Clear PTM & FP Inputlist when switching to edit mode
- New Context Menu:
    - Add Node
        - Popup Form where you can enter:
            - Type of Node (options: Gene/Protein, Metabolite/Compound, Pathway)
            - For Gene/Protein:
                - List of Names (first one will implicitly become default one)
                - List of Uniprot Accession Numbers
        -> Create node at position of right-click
            - Just add to what is parsed from the JSON
    - Add Edge
        - Await two clicks 'After clicking confirm, please click on the source, then the target node.'
        - Increase Border of node after click to feedback selection
        - Popup Form where you can choose edge type and optionally set a label (e.g. '+p')
- Export: Create JSON using current positions 
    - Node: Add Edge to...
    - Node: Add Edge from...
    - Edge: Change Edge Type
    - Edge: Delete Edge
    - Node: Delete Node -> Need to delete all adjacent edges too -> AND HIGHER ORDER LINKS!
    - Create Group
    - Edge: Change Label
    - Node: Change Node Type
    - Node: Change Name(s)
    - Group: Delete Group -> Merge code with Delete Node, it is similar
    - Group: When addition of group clears another group, delete orphaned edges (you can probably reuse code from delete group, since you're implicitly deleting a group here)
    - Edge: Add Anchor Edge
    - When adding edge, highlight selected groups and edges similarly to how nodes are highlighted

    
Todo:

    - Cancel Button does not reset edit node type (and maybe other menues?)

- In PTMNavigator:
    - User should be able to enter editing mode when no pathway is loaded (initialize with empty skeleton)
    - User should be able to give pathway a name
    - "Save" button, when leaving edit mode ask to save/export

Update or overwrite a Pathway in the DB (Upsert?) Must work by ID somehow... user needs to be able to edit their Previously designed pws
	-> If pathway already exists, it has an id. So send this alongside the JSON. If it sent, do not query for new ID, and update instead of inserting.
Inconsistent use of Link and Edge throughout the code
