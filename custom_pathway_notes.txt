Done:
- mode: viewing/editing
    - Create storybook with switch, same as for the hue + upload and download button
    - Clear PTM & FP Inputlist when switching to edit mode
- New Context Menu:
    - Add Node
        - Popup Form where you can enter:
            - Type of Node (options: Gene/Protein, Metabolite/Compound, Pathway)
            - For Gene/Protein:
                - List of Names (first one will implicitly become default one)
                - List of Uniprot Accession Numbers
        -> Create node at position of right-click
            - Just add to what is parsed from the JSON
    - Add Edge
        - Await two clicks 'After clicking confirm, please click on the source, then the target node.'
        - Increase Border of node after click to feedback selection
        - Popup Form where you can choose edge type and optionally set a label (e.g. '+p')
- Export: Create JSON using current positions 
    - Node: Add Edge to...
    - Node: Add Edge from...
    - Edge: Change Edge Type
    - Edge: Delete Edge
    - Node: Delete Node -> Need to delete all adjacent edges too -> AND HIGHER ORDER LINKS!
    - Create Group
    - Edge: Change Label
    - Node: Change Node Type
    - Node: Change Name(s)
    - Group: Delete Group -> Merge code with Delete Node, it is similar
    - Group: When addition of group clears another group, delete orphaned edges (you can probably reuse code from delete group, since you're implicitly deleting a group here)
    - Edge: Add Anchor Edge
    - When adding edge, highlight selected groups and edges similarly to how nodes are highlighted
